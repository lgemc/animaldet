# Experiments

Experiments are all set up required in order to run training and evaluation of external or internal models on specific datasets.

The main idea is that any external dependencies are handled in the experiment folder, and then exported to the main animaldet framework.

We also want to keep as much as possible of the code in the main imported framework, so that we can easily update and maintain it
and keep experiments as simple as possible.
